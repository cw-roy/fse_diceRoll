# __New assignment for week 12:  Dice Roller__:heavy_check_mark:

## Activity: A Dice Roller

## Items for completion

__The user should be able to tell you how many dice they want to roll:__ :heavy_check_mark:

- __HTML Task:__ Create a [text input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text). :heavy_check_mark:

__The user should be able to tell you when they are ready to roll the dice:__ :heavy_check_mark:

- __HTML Task:__ Create a "Roll!" [button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button). :heavy_check_mark:

__The user should see the total of all the dice that were rolled:__  :heavy_check_mark:

- __HTML Task:__ Create a "Total" element on the page. :heavy_check_mark:

__The user should be able to tell you when they are ready to see the roll of every die individually (in addition to the Total):__  :heavy_check_mark:

__The user should see the result of every individual die on the page (in addition to the Total):__  :heavy_check_mark:

- __HTML Task:__ Create an "All Rolls" element on the page. :heavy_check_mark:

### 3. On user request, roll those dice and show the total to the user  :heavy_check_mark:

### 4. On user request, show all of the individual die rolls to the user (4 points) :heavy_check_mark:

### Extra Credit

- Create a reset button which, on click, will empty the array and the `innerHTML` of your Total and All Rolls elements.  :heavy_check_mark:

- Create a user input box, where a user can specify the number of sides on the dice. For example, instead of six-sided dice, the user could opt for a 20-sided die.  :heavy_check_mark:

- Make each "dice roll" element look more like an actual six-sided (cube) die. You don't have to show dice pips â€“ numbers are fine. Just find some ways to style these "dice" elements to help the user "see" them as dice.
